# Fall Pomodoro - A Pomodoro Timer

## Overview
**Fall Pomodoro** is a simple yet powerful Pomodoro timer web application developed for **FallHacks 2023**. It's designed to help users manage their time more effectively, especially during work and study sessions. The project covers a range of programming topics including **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Choose from three timer options: Focus (25 minutes), Short Break (5 minutes), and Long Break (15 minutes).

- **Visual Appeal**: The user interface is designed to be visually appealing, with a background image and interactive buttons.

- **Control Buttons**: Start, pause, and reset functionality to give you complete control over your work intervals and breaks.

- **Background Enhancement**: A soothing background image and optional sound effects contribute to a more pleasant work environment.

## Programming Topics Covered

- **HTML**: The HTML file (`index.html`) is the foundation of the project, defining the structure and content of the web application.

- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style the interface, including background images, fonts, and button animations.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is responsible for the timer logic and user interactions. It handles timer countdown, button clicks, and audio playback.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to your local machine.

2. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in your web browser to start using Fall Pomodoro.

3. Customize the Pomodoro timer intervals by modifying the JavaScript code to suit your preferences.

4. Feel free to replace the background images and sounds with your own to create a personalized experience.

## Usage

- Click on the "Focus," "Short Break," or "Long Break" buttons to start the corresponding timer.

- The timer will count down, and you can see the remaining time displayed in the center.
