# Fall Pomodoro - A Pomodoro Timer

## Overview
**Fall Pomodoro** is a simple yet powerful Pomodoro timer web application developed for **FallHacks 2023**. It's designed to help users manage their time more effectively, especially during work and study sessions. The project covers a range of programming topics including **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Choose from three timer options: Focus (25 minutes), Short Break (5 minutes), and Long Break (15 minutes).

- **Visual Appeal**: The user interface is designed to be visually appealing, with a background image and interactive buttons.

- **Control Buttons**: Start, pause, and reset functionality to give you complete control over your work intervals and breaks.

- **Background Enhancement**: A soothing background image and optional sound effects contribute to a more pleasant work environment.

## Programming Topics Covered

- **HTML**: The HTML file (`index.html`) is the foundation of the project, defining the structure and content of the web application.

- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style the interface, including background images, fonts, and button animations.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is responsible for the timer logic and user interactions. It handles timer countdown, button clicks, and audio playback.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to your local machine.

2. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in your web browser to start using Fall Pomodoro.

3. Customize the Pomodoro timer intervals by modifying the JavaScript code to suit your preferences.
```java
<button class="button-card-focus" onclick="changeTimer(25)">Focus</button>
<button class="button-card-short-break" onclick="changeTimer(5)">Short Break</button>
<button class="button-card" onclick="changeTimer(15)">Long Break</button>
```

4. Feel free to replace the background images and sounds with your own to create a personalized experience.

## Usage

- Click on the "Focus," "Short Break," or "Long Break" buttons to start the corresponding timer.

- The timer will count down, and you can see the remaining time displayed in the center.

- You can play, pause, and reset the timer using the control buttons.

- When the timer reaches zero, a sound will play to alert you.
